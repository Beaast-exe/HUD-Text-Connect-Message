<h1>New Custom HUD Connect Message</h1>

A new Connect Message plugin for <u><b> CS:GO servers</b></u>, using the Source Mod Addon;

<h2>Why another connect message since it exists many of them on public?</h2>

Well, since the last update, Valve added a new custom HUD, which can be used for so many things.

Things that this connect message plugin has:

<ul>
<li>Everything written using the Transitional Syntax.</li>
<li>CVARs to set which color you want to the text (using the RGB colors code).</li>
<li>CVARs to set how much time to Fade In or Out.</li>
<li>CVAR to set how much time you want to hold the text in your screen.</li>
<li>CVARS to set the position you want (horizontal or vertical) in your screen.</li>
</ul>


Installation:
<ol>
<li>Drag the file named <i>newhud_connectmessage.smx</i> to <b>addons/sourcemod/plugins</b>.</li>
<li>Load the plugin or just wait for the next map.</li>
<li>Change the times, colors and coordenates as you wish in the file <i>newhud_connectmessage.cfg</i> located in <b>cfg/sourcemod</b></li>
</ol>

I hope you enjoyed!
