#New Custom HUD Connect Message

A new Connect Message plugin for <u><b> CS:GO servers</b></u>, using the Source Mod Addon;

<h1>Why another connect message since it exists so many of them?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Added Translations, to be easy to configure to server owners.</li>
<li>Added colors to the translations, if you want a colorfull text.</li>
<li>Added a CVAR to change the time you want to be fully god mode.</li>
<li>Converted everything to the new Syntax.</li>
</ul>


Installation:
<ol>
<li>Drag the file named <i>telekill_protect.smx</i> to <b>sourcemod/plugins</b>.</li>
<li>Drag the file named <i>sm_telekill_protection.phrases.txt</i> to <b>sourcemod/translations</b>.</li>
<li>Load the plugin or just wait for the next map.</li>
</ol>

For the developers:

To compile, you need the ColorVariables include (to add the colors) - https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=267743

Known bugs:

The trigger_push entity can also triggers this, which I didn't fix yet for private reasons (I will release a new version ASAP).

I hope you enjoyed!
